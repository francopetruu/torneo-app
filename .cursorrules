# Beach Football Tournament - Cursor AI Rules

## Project Context
You are building a Progressive Web Application for managing beach football tournaments.
This is a full-stack TypeScript project with React frontend and Supabase backend.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime + Auth + Storage)
- Deployment: Vercel
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Code Standards
- Always use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow functional React components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (no CSS modules)
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch
- Add TypeScript JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use conventional commits format

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests with Vitest for utilities
- Write integration tests for API calls
- Ensure >80% code coverage for critical paths

## File Organization
- Components in /components with subfolders by feature
- Custom hooks in /hooks
- Types in /types
- Utils in /lib
- Pages in /pages

## Database
- Always use Supabase client from @/lib/supabase
- Use TypeScript types generated from database schema
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Use database triggers for auto-calculations

## Real-time Features
- Subscribe to Supabase Realtime for live updates
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
- Handle connection errors gracefully

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., StandingsTable)
- Files: kebab-case (e.g., standings-table.tsx)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., fetchStandings)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_FILE_SIZE)

## Security
- Never commit .env files
- Always validate user input
- Sanitize data before database queries
- Use Supabase RLS for data access control

## Performance
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Use React Query for data caching
- Implement pagination for large datasets

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML
- Include ARIA labels where needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain color contrast ratios

## Error Handling
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log errors to console in development
- Send errors to Sentry in production
- Implement fallback UI for errors
